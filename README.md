# React native course

Hi! I'm currently following the course [React Native - The Practical Guide 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/) and these are my notes and code.

## Requirements

To run this project (assuming MacOS) you need NodeJS, Yarn, and Expo-cli. To download NodeJS click [here](). Install Yarn through `brew` with

```
brew install yarn
```

The following command worked for me to install the expo-cli, your milage may vary.

```
npm install expo-cli -g --allow-root --unsafe-perm=true
```

## Usage

If it is your first run 

```
git clone https://github.com/Rainymood/rn-complete-guide
cd rn-complete-guide
yarn add expo
```

Otherwise just

```
npm start
```

Then open a simulator and click on `run in iOS simulation` in Expo
DevTools.

## What the app looks like
