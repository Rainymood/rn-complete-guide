# React native course

Hi! I'm currently following the course [React Native - The Practical Guide 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/) and these are my notes and code.

## Requirements

To run it on MacOS you need: 

* NodeJS
* Yarn
* Expo-cli

## Usage

Clone the repo and run

```
npm start
```

Then open a simulator and in Expo DevTools click on `run on iOS simulator`. 

## What the app looks like
